JSON Amateur Radio Bandplan data and a HTML renderer

Not much here so far, this is just some JSON Amateur Radio Bandplan data in a format that makes sense when rendering the to a HTML page. There are probably better ways to achieve this, but this is how I'm going it for now. The JSON data is also incomplete.

What it doesn't do: 
* display primary / secondary allocations
* display licence types
* may or may no display band gaps properly
